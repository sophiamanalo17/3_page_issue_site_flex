        <h1>WHAT & WHY YOU SHOULD CARE.</h1>
        <p>Making abortion legal is important for several reasons. Firstly, it upholds women's reproductive rights, allowing them autonomy over their bodies and decisions regarding their reproductive health. Legalizing abortion ensures access to safe and regulated procedures, reducing the risks associated with unsafe, clandestine practices. This contributes to public health by preventing complications, injuries, and deaths resulting from illegal abortions. Additionally, legal abortion acknowledges and respects the diverse circumstances women may face, including cases of unplanned pregnancies, fetal abnormalities, or threats to the mother's health. It promotes social equality by providing all women, regardless of socioeconomic status, with the option to make choices aligned with their individual circumstances. Legalizing abortion acknowledges the complexity of reproductive decisions and fosters a framework where women can seek medical care and support without fear of legal repercussions, contributing to a more compassionate and inclusive society.</p>
